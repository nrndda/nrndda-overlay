  Condor is a open-source, specialized workload management system for
  compute-intensive jobs. Like other full-featured batch systems, Condor
  provides a job queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme,
  resource monitoring, and resource management. Users submit their serial
  or parallel jobs to Condor, Condor places them into a queue, chooses
  when and where to run the jobs based upon a policy, carefully monitors
  their progress, and ultimately informs the user upon completion. Condor
  also contains mechanisms to submit jobs to grid-sites and supports many
  different grid toolkits.
